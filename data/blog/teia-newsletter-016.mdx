_Where Art Meets Tokens, Pride Meets Tezos, and Fountains Flow_

It has been quite some time since the last newsletter. The active Teians have been focusing on the next steps of building the Teia DAO and distributing the Teia DAO governance tokens, and this newsletter will update you on the DAO development and the currently running community vote, but also on Teia‚Äôs fountain that is still pouring, this years #TezosPride event and a look back at Teias showcase at NFTNYC last month.

For any other questions, hop into the Teia Discord!

## Call for representatives

By the way, we are working on our Teia Community Equity Representative development currently and we are seeking input and participation from 2SLGBTQIA+, BIPOC, Women/Nonbinary, CIND (Chronically ill, Immunocompromised, Neurodivergent and Disabled) as well as regions within the Global South! If you or someone you know may be interested in contributing please join the conversation in discord in the #Representatives channel!

Teia is about to take a huge step forward in its quest for decentralisation: we will soon conduct the first round of Governance Token distribution.

Currently, Teia is governed by a multisig of 19 members who hold legal responsibility and ownership over Teia's newly established Teia DAO LLC until the Tokens are distributed and ownership will be distributed among the Token holders. To ensure democratic and equitable governance, the initial DAO setup for Teia will be governed through token-based voting and a multisig contract of community representatives [(more info on that on our wiki).](https://github.com/teia-community/teia-docs/wiki/Governance-on-Teia)

### Distribution what?

We want to reward all the contributing factors to Teia so far and ensure that the voting power for the Teia DAO is distributed proportionally to everyone's interest and contribution to the ecosystem around the Hic et Nunc OBJKT Tokens used by Teia.

Teia's DAO Tokens will mostly be distributed based on activity and contribution to both Hic et Nunc and Teia. Additionally, there will be a 1:1 reward for each hDAO token.

**Note** that no token value above being a voting token is implied. The Teia DAO Token is solely intended as a governance token and should not be treated as a financial/investment asset. Due to its non-profit nature, Teia can't and won't distribute profits and can only use funds generated to maintain operations, fund exhibitions, and support education, art, and cultural exchange in general.

For everyone who would like to learn more about Teia's DAO Token and read up on all the details of the distribution model, we have prepared a [fact sheet with an extensive FAQ section](https://blog.teia.art/blog/fact-sheet-token-drop) that should cover most information about the tokens and distribution.

### We want your vote!

Teia is currently holding a community vote about the total supply of Teia DAO Tokens that will be minted.

Since Teia Tokens will have a fixed supply and hDAO has a fixed supply of 650k Tokens, the overall supply of Teia tokens will determine the voting power allocated to hDAO rewards. The bigger the overall Token supply is, the smaller the relative voting power allocated to hDAO rewards.

You can take part in the vote here on [vote.teia.art](https://vote.teia.art/vote/QmeJ9ATjn4ge9phDzvpmdZzRZdRoKJdyk4swPiVgaxAx6z), but we highly suggest first taking a look at the [Voting thread on Discourse](https://discourse.teia.art/t/vote-discussion-total-supply-of-teia-dao-tokens/625#the-voting-options-6) and the distribution sheets for the different supplies.

### We got audio

In order to inform the community about the Token distribution and vote, we organised twitter spaces in early june in different languages, that are now available to be listened back on twitter as recordings. In these spaces we gave the community a general update on the DAO setup, the token distribution and the token supply vote.

Here you can find the recordings:

- [English I](https://twitter.com/TeiaCommunity/status/1663105057703751685?s=20)
- [Spanish](https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1kvJpmXrOmdxE?s=20)
- [Chinese](https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1ynKOapEAoQJR?s=20)
- [Portugese](https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1DXGyvpWMvYJM?s=20)
- [English II](https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1vOxwMoQlYNGB) (APAC region focus)

### Did we miss you?

IIf you have made a substantial contribution to Hic et Nunc and/or Teia and think you [satisify one or multiple of the contribution criteria](https://blog.teia.art/blog/fact-sheet-token-drop#contribution-rewards) but did not receive a "contribution_level" of 1 or 2 in [row E of the sheets](https://blog.teia.art/blog/fact-sheet-token-drop#the-community-vote-on-total-supply-of-teia-tokens), please contact us at info@teia.art and describe your contribution. We will discuss adding you to the contributors list within the core team before setting up the actual token drop.

### What‚Äôs next?

A few weeks after the vote has concluded, the total supply of Teia Tokens will be minted and then distributed via a token claim page. The distribution period, during which tokens can be claimed, will be roughly 2-3 months.

Once the distribution period is over, we will enter the DAO beta phase, where Teians can already use the DAO contracts and Tokens to set up proposals and vote. We will need to test the DAO contracts this way before assigning ownership to the smart contracts and token holders.

For example, one of the trickiest parameters in the DAO votes will be the ‚Äúquorum‚Äù: how many votes are needed at minimum for a proposal to be able to pass. This is an important way to control random or malicious proposals from passing during times of low interest.

After the DAO contracts are properly tested, the core team will assign ownership of the Teia DAO LLC to the DAO contracts and its members (=Token holders), at which point Teia's quest to becoming a truly community-owned platform will reach its first major goal: true collective ownership. Of course, the DAO setup will need to be changed and evolved constantly by its members.

## Meet the current core team

So, who is currently behind all of this? For 1.5 years, Teia has been kept running "somehow," but the people behind the operations never formally introduced themselves. The core team multisig is currently the legal owner of the Teia DAO LLC, and we want to be transparent about who is a member of that multisig.

Last month, we published [a Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/TeiaCommunity/status/1656051408079327236?s=20) in which all 19 core team multisig members gave a brief introduction and officially greeted the community. We also added the bios to [our wiki here](https://github.com/teia-community/teia-docs/wiki/Core-Team/), so everyone knows who is behind Teia currently and building the structures needed for our DAO to be fully community-owned.

Teia still relies fully on pro bono work by the whole team; no one from the team gets monetary compensation. In spirit, Teia is supposed to be run by its users and relies on volunteer contributions by the community. Everyone (yes, you too) can help make Teia a better place or develop/organize the next cool development or event for Teia. If you are interested, please join the Teia discord and ask about volunteer opportunities or bring your own ideas on how you can improve the space.

Next up, we will publish a similar Twitter thread that includes all the regular/active contributors from the wider team who are not part of the core team multisig but are also heavily involved in keeping Teia running. So stay tuned!

## Still dabbling: The Teia fountain!

Are you an artist who needs their first Tezos tokens to start minting in the vast Tezos NFT ecosystem? The Fountain has got you covered. New artists with an empty account can apply for a drop of 0.5 free Tezos, donated by the community and distributed by The Fountain team, to help make Teia (and other Tezos marketplaces) more accessible to people without access to crypto.

### how to get a tez drop

Please fill out [the Fountain Application Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeT1Bm95K1ASVPMv2F0864COcKmm_-FGKortlEHMtMMLfNFZQ/viewform).

After completing the form, please send us a message either in the #fountain channel on the [Teias Discord](https://discord.gg/mDH4KMqXJF) or via email at info@teia.art and let us know that you have completed the form.

We close our Newsletter with a small look back at our presence at NFTNYC!

![IMG_3296](https://github.com/teia-community/teia-blog/assets/97635650/323e15e8-212a-4a9c-98d9-37ad355ce92d)

We were invited by the Tezos Foundation for a last minute curation opportunity to exhibit work from the Teia Community at their NFTNYC event. The team decided to celebrate mints from #SwapOnTeia and took efforts to select artworks from a variety of mediums, regions and identities to showcase the wide range of participants in the Teia community. 

Thank you to all who have minted and participated in #SwapOnTeia ! All fees from Teia swaps goes toward supporting Teia and paying for the cost of maintaining the marketplace!
