_first issue of the new teia newsletter. all news, all lower case_
**( [Espanol](/blog/es/teia-newsletter-001) )**

welcome to the teia newsletter

from now on i won't call these (somewhat) regular writeups of the state of the project "discord recaps" anymore and will try to stick to newsletter because i will try to bring together infos from various comms channels here.

also: if anyone wants to write a newsletter or contribute to it it, that would be awesome. it would be great to get some more diverse points of view. I am doing this mainly because people asked for writeups and i try to keep an overview anyways. but if its only one person writing these, it might be a very narrow view onto everything. feel free to contact me ([@MerchantCoppola](https://twitter.com/MerchantCoppola)).

## teia launch

a lot has happened in the last week. on 2/2/22 we started the teia "soft launch" with introducing our new main domain "[teia.art](https://teia.art/)" and with it a rotating logo: on each site refresh a random logo gets displayed from a pool of submissions. you can find an overview of all the logos on the [logo viewer](https://teia.vercel.app/)

this is supposed to be in place until we decide on a final logo solution, but it is also possible to keep the rotating logos if the community wants that. also: as of now there is no deadline to
[submit new logos via the google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe27ZughzLlh44BQXjrXto4b9qRTAB9SX-d-YMTCUPYdD6lRg/viewform)

you can find the [launch info article](https://hencommunity.quest/blog/teia-art-launch-announcement) with a lot of info on the current state of the project and our on our blog.
[alex crouwers](https://twitter.com/acrwrs) and [turbulent determinism](https://twitter.com/turbulentdeterm) finished the [official launch pressrelease](https://hencommunity.quest/blog/teia-launch-press-release) that will be sent out to press contacts and can be used for reference. if you know news/press contact or want to help spread the word, pls hop onto the #pr-communication channel on our discord.

our next celebratory date will be 22/2/22 - we work on having a few more features ready for that and maybe the community has some ideas for launch events, hastags, celebrations we could use to celebrate the launch. bring your ideas to the #events channel on our discord.

## The new smartcontract

teia uses the same minting contract as hicetnunc. this means OBJKTs minted on teia will show up on all marketplaces that support hen OBJKTs (i.e. objkt.com, rarible, hic.af, etc).
currently we still use the hicetnunc v2 swapping contract. this means that platform fees from collects both on teia and hicetnunc still get directed to the wallet of hicetnunc. in order to collect our own platform fees, [jagracar](https://twitter.com/jagracar) has written and completed a new swapping contract for teia and a multisignature contract that makes it possible to manage the collected fees collectively. Those two new smartcontract have now passed the audit.

[official smartcontract announcement on twitter](https://twitter.com/TeiaCommunity/status/1490285938047651840?s=20&t=kojgwlsJpSGO2fNKhcE05Q)

[a general overview over the new smartcontracts is on our blog](https://blog.teia.art/blog/introducing-henc-smart-contracts)

[the full audit report on github](https://github.com/InferenceAG/ReportPublications/blob/master/Inference%20AG%20-%20Teia%20community%20-%20marketplace%20&%20multisig%20-%20v1.0.pdf)

## swapping contract support

with the new smart contract we need to decide how and if we are going to show other swaps (listing prices) of OBJKTs. there are multiple paths we can go: do we show swaps of platforms that show our swaps? do we show all OBJKT swaps and try to position teia as the "platform where you can find all OBJKT prices on one site?” or do we want to only show teia swaps? all these options have certain implications for the usability and positioning of teia in the tez ecosystem.

the communication with objktcom has started on that, probably the same discussions will come up with other platforms soon.

[read and discuss the swap support on discourse ](https://discourse.hencommunity.quest/t/teia-art-swaps-and-objkt-com/581)

note that this discussion is **not** about showing other tokens minted on other contracts, like tokens minted on objktcom or versum. those are all different minting contracts and we aren't able to display those, at least for now.

## roadmap

[badlament](https://twitter.com/Thebadlament) started updating our [notion page](https://teia-community.notion.site/TEIA-COMMUNITY-3a21f2ddd52b40069c7809b85a7ffbf3): there is now an [updated roadmap](https://teia-community.notion.site/8d36022f07d24869b718f225183c92d0?v=6f41db61ab604f6895161502abcaf549) and the [current version of our code of conduct.](https://teia-community.notion.site/Code-of-Conduct-Terms-Conditions-Core-Values-b79fc969a66246f18706be742d2e7baf)

we started a page to list the people that are currently actively working in the different working groups. the plan is to merge these lists with the planned guilds and the org structure proposed by [malicious sheep](https://twitter.com/malsheep56) and [babycommando](https://twitter.com/BabyCommando_). we need to get our working groups sorted, this will also be a first step towards setting up core teams/guilds for our organisation-structure.

in general now that working groups seem to have formed we need to find better ways to improve communication between those groups and start bringing in volunteers from our [volunteer submission form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1qEsPN5njEE9fNdSM1zjetIYGYTSuMpjPl446nG1FvNY/viewform?edit_requested=true) - we currently have 40 people that are waiting for assignments!

## dev department

currently the Dev channels are working on preparing our [community githup repository](https://github.com/teia-community) to be deployed (at the moment [manitcors](https://twitter.com/TezTools) [hicetnunc git is the one we use](https://github.com/IntegroLabs/hicetnunc/)) for this transition, repos need to be cleaned up, changes need to be synced, etc.

## UI/UX

[synkitty](https://twitter.com/Synkitty0) shared a [doc that summarizes some rules we should keep in mind to keep to our vision of accessibility](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1W94d6BfuVJMQROqCC4Mgs0BBP4T61zlnIdzm2bYVbnI/edit?usp=sharing). not only interesting for UI devs but also a good read for everyone that contributes.

there are UI improvements that have been developed during the hicathon that could be implemented rather easily if wanted. you can have a look at the[ hicathon UI WG presentation](https://www.figma.com/proto/R5sw1HcoHx4Aup1Yl7rGYA/WG-UI%2FUX?page-id=0%3A1&node-id=1473%3A12670&viewport=241%2C48%2C0.03&scaling=contain).

more UI requests include: option to filter out certain tags, masonry view, bring back the logo marking interactive pieces, switching between a minimal/zen UI mode and a more detailed “full” mode with price tags and the list goes on.

denscimonk shared some [ideas on what could be done next on discord](https://discordapp.com/channels/908672304236625970/909363941283598336/940393550200316005)

the question remains how and if we should vote on every change or let the UI team proceed a little. another idea would be to use one of the mirrors to test things without votes and let people check it out.

## @TeiaArt - twitter account for community art curation

while we were saving domains and handles during the last voting round, community members saved a lot of teia-realted twitter handles. our main announcement handle now is [@TeiaCommunity.](https://twitter.com/TeiaCommunity)

[qizzio](https://twitter.com/qizzio) and [mumuthestan](https://twitter.com/mumu_thestan) developed the idea to use another handle, [@teiaart](https://twitter.com/TeiaArt), for a shared curation experiment: every day a new community member gets access to the account via tweetdeck and can share, quote retweet art or write art curation threads. the number of applications after the first announcement was so high, the form needed to be closed for now unfortunately - but it will be reopened eventually.
