_Let's celebrate Pride Month on the Blockchain!_


## About the event

#TezosPride is an ongoing event to celebrate Pride and to support our 2SLGBTQ+ siblings across the tezos ecosystem. It was initially set up to celabrate pride month 2022 and has been continued as a separate Teia feed for proud art.

The Hashtag will be used every pridemonth and there is no intended end to the event, so feel free to add your pride related pieces throughout the year and discover all the art from previous years through the hashtag.

Lets spend Pride month educating ourselves, celebrating and amplifying our 2SLGBTQ+ siblings across the tezos ecosystem!

### Setting up a split of the sales for charity causes

Please note that starting a collab can cost more than regular minting. When establishing a collab, updating profile, minting and signing, it will cost around 1-2 tez, so make sure you are calculating that when setting your price and beneficiary split! Make sure you are adding these addresses under collab contracts as "Beneficiary" and not "Collaborator" otherwise your work will remain unsigned and unverified on Teia. For this process, please see the guide for adding a beneficiary as described in the Ukraine Fundraiser Guide, ensuring you use the correct address for the person or entity you wish to collab with!

[A guide on how to set up a collab cobtract for fundraiser events can be found on this wiki article](https://github.com/teia-community/teia-docs/wiki/Collab-contract-Guide#setting-up-a-contract-for-fundraisers)
