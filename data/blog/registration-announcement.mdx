_Teia is now a legally recognized DAO. What does that mean? What's next?_

# Announcement: Teia DAO LLC incorporation and next steps

We are excited to announce that Teia is now an official legal entity! We received confirmation from our registrar service [MIDAO](https://www.midao.org/) that we are now a registered non-profit DAO LLC incorporated in the Republic of Marshall Islands. This is the result of almost one year of research, building, coding, and discussions. Let's look at the details!
