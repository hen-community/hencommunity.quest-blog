_experience your OBJKTs in a new dimension_

Teia just received a nice little new feature: **3D previews for your NFTs**! 
This new addition allows you to experience your tokens in a immersive genertive 3D space.
To use the feature, simply hit the new ‚Äúsee in 3D‚Äù button next to the full screen button on Teias token page and view it in a generative [anaver.se](https://anaver.se/) 3D space. 
You can walk around it, move it somewhere else, add other tokens to go with it and do all that collaboratively with the other people connected! 
A single click brings you back to the original view.

This feature, contributed by user anaglyphic via a simple github PR not only enhances the user experience on Teia but is also a great example of how our open-source development model works. 
Many thanks to all who actively contribute to the Teia.art community!
